# Groupie-Tracker-Search-Bar

Groupie tracker search bar consists of creating a functional program that searches, inside groupie tracker website, for a specific text input. So the focus of this project is to create a way for the client to search a member or artist or any other attribute in the data system.

## Objectives
The program should handle at least these search cases : 
- artist/band name
- members
- locations
- first album date
- creation date
The program must handle search input as case-insensitive.

The search bar must have typing suggestions as you write. 
- The search bar must identify and display in each suggestion the individual type of the search cases. (ex: Freddie Mercury -> member)
- For example if you start writing "phil" it should appear as suggestions Phil Collins - member and Phil Collins - artist/band. This is just an example of a display.
